        This will test your ability to create and execute an efficient route. There are (literally) trillions of
        possible ways to combine these mini-tasks into 1 run.<br/><br/>

        Complete a task, get the points for it. Complete a whole section, get 3 extra points. You have 1 minute to get
        as many points as possible.<br/><br/>

        You can post in general with any questions and I'll add the answers to the clarifications.<br/><br/><br/><br/>


        <RuleList>
           <p> Grabbing any monkey counts for monkey </p>
           <p> Everything except cannon and monkey can be done more than once. </p>
           <p> Red coins count as 2 coins </p>
           <p> Only unique signs count </p>
           <p> To 'kill' a bomb is to make it explode, or throw it off a cliff. </p>
           <p> Entering the cannon and not shooting counts (makes it a good final objective) </p>
        </RuleList>
